I'm gonna find someone to love me,For who I am, a perfect star,So lay your head down and you'll feel me,An empty prayer shot to the heart,And remember when you hold me,I'm everything you that you want and more,And if you find someone to love you like I can,That's what dog's are for,To find you with no one there,I'll kiss you in the black light,Will they still love you when you kiss the flame,Take you to the border in the ocean rain,Turn into the fire but you know it hurts,I'll be your baby I'll say anything,Love you like a stranger,I kissed you in the movies,With a bitter heart and a cynic's eye,And yes Jesus walked on water,Died with grace and made you mine,So lay your head down and you'll feel me,An empty prayer, electric light,And if you find someone to love you,Remember me before it dies,To find you with no one there,I'll kiss you in the black light,You'll wipe away all my tears,We'll shiver in the midnight,Will they still love you when you kiss the flame,Take you to the border in the ocean rain,Turn into the fire but you know it hurts,Slip inside the wire when you know for sure,To be your baby I'll say anything,I'll say anything,Love me like a stranger,So you say a prayer for the dying sun,From the car to the corner,Your will be done,Here on earth and little Tokyo,From the first street bridge to the neon glow,It's a suicide,Claim to fame,Paid testimony and a brand new name,So you load the gun,Here we go again,You're the face in the mirror my favorite sin,But you want revenge from the Lord above,So the rain comes down heavy like my love,Heavy like my love,Will they still love you when you kiss the flame,Take you to the border in the ocean rain,Turn into the fire but you know it hurts,Slip inside the wire when you know for sure,Will they still love you when you kiss the flame,Take you to the border in the ocean rain,Turn into the fire but you know it hurts,Slip inside the wire when you know for sure,To be your baby I'll say anything,I'll say anything,Just love me like a stranger
