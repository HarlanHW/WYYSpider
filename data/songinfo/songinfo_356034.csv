作词 : GALA,作曲 : GALA,sunday's coming I wanna drive my car,to your apartment with present like a star,forecaster said the weather may be rainy hard,but I know the sun will shine for us,oh lazy seagull fly me from the dark,I dress my jeans and feed my monkey banana,then I think my age how old,skyline how far,or we need each other in california,you show me your body before night comes down,I touch your face and promise to stay ever young,on this ivory beach we kissed so long,it seems that the passion's never gone,you sing me your melody and I feel so please,I want you to want me to keep your dream,together we'll run wild by a summer symphony,this is what we enjoyed not a fantasy,the tin-man's surfing I wanna try my luck,to the top of tide rip like just have some drugs,I know you have no blame for my proud moonish heart,Welcome to the golden beatnik park,oh diamond seashore drag me from the yard,incredible sunward I watch as you're in photograph,for camera your smile's so sweet,palm trees' so lush,would you believe my honey it's califonia,you show me your body before night comes down,I touch your face and promise to stay ever young,on this ivory beach we kissed so long,it seems that the passion's never gone,you sing me your melody and I feel so please,I want you to want me to keep your dream,together we'll run wild by a summer symphony,this is what we enjoyed not a fantasy
