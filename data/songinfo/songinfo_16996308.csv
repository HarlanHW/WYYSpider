You can hang on to me,But my love won't surround you,Now that you're finally gone,I am free to get on with my life,You can summon all the gods,That your black heart desires,They cannot help you 'cause they're starting fires,To burn you alive,Tell it to the volcano, from what,I know you're goin' down the hole,Down you're goin' down the hole, tell it to the volcano,Save your sorry's, tell it to the volcano,A year ago today,I was fallin' in love with you,I didn't know how,I could tell you,You were breaking my heart, shrinking my head,I couldn't get out of my bed,Tell it to the volcano, from what,I know you're goin' down the hole,Down you're goin' down the hole, tell it to the volcano,Save your sorry's, tell it to the volcano,Oom, I'd like to chuck ya,Oom, I'd like to chuck ya,Oom, I'd like to chuck ya,Oom, I'd like to chuck ya,Oom, I'd like to chuck ya,Oom, I'd like to chuck ya down,Oom, I'd like to chuck ya,Oom, I'd like to throw away the pain on my own,You're cryin' and you're screamin',And you're beggin' not to go,Tell it to the volcano,Down you're goin' down the hole, tell it to the volcano,Save your sorry's, tell it to the volcano,Oom, I'd like to chuck ya,Oom, I'd like to chuck ya,Oom, I'd like to chuck ya,Oom, I'd like to chuck ya,Oom, I'd like to chuck ya,Oom, I'd like to chuck ya down
