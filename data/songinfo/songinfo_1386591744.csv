作词 : Felt,作曲 : Felt,She keeps her biz boomin' down front street,Open with the funk so that no one wants beef,She the type who like to lay it all on the line,Say what's on her mind that way it ain't a crime,The crime is had you shown no shame,Had you make those claims like you play no games,When in reality you the biggest player of them all,The princess that wore the most layers to the ball,Tryin' to cover up when you layin' in your drawers,You front like you a freak and everything you say is raw,But deep down you really scared he's gonna leave ya,Your closet got more skeletons than the dia,Esqueleto you worse than my perros,My dogs that only f*ck with broads from the ghetto,You date losers cause it make you feel superior,Try to tell me lies to justify but all I'm hearin' is the,Bass......Bass.........Bass...........,She seems like the type with no taste for shame,It walks like a snake then they can't complain,Naw people love you and cling to them raw fumes,Keep it up so we don't see through your costume,She been a little queen since 15,In and out of different scenes never kept her image clean,So critical over analytical,Fast forward of course old and miserable,Long trail of bread crumbs and head games,Bed bums the best ones get pet names,First glance you can see the dirt,Closet door wide open no need to search,Naw the truth is just an excuse,That you use to polish up a pair of selfish shoes,Take it how you want go face up the front,Cause them skeletons dance to the bass bass bass,Bass......Bass.........Bass...........
