Ben Folds - You Don't Know Me (feat. Regina Spektor),,I want to ask you,Do you ever sit and wonder,It's so strange,That we could be together for so long,And never know, never care,What goes on in the other one's head,Things I've felt but I never said,You said things that I never said,So I'll say something that I should have said long ago,You don't know me,You don't know me at all,You don't know me,You don't know me at all,(At all...),,You could have just propped me up on the table like a mannequin,Or a cardboard stand up and paint me (paint me anything),Any face that you wanted me to be,See, we're damned by the existential moment,Where we saw the couple in the coma,And it was we who were the cliche,But we carried on anyway,So sure I can just close my eyes,Yeah, sure, trace and memorize,But can you go back once you know?,You don't know me,You don't know me at all,You don't know me,You don't know me at all,(At all...),,You don't know me,You don't know me at all,You don't know me,You don't know me,If I'm the person that you think I am (Ahh....),Clueless chump you seem to think I am (Ahh...),So easily led astray, an arid dog who occasionally escapes,and needs a shorter leash then,Why the **** would you want me back?,Maybe it's because...,You don't know me at all,(Ahhhh, ahh...),You don't know me, you don't know me,(Ahhhh, ahh...),,So what I'm trying to say is,What I'm trying to tell you is not going to come out like I want to say it,Cause I know you'll only change it,Say it,You don't know me,You don't know me at all,You don't know me,You don't know me at all,(At all...),,You don't know me,You don't know me at all,You don't know me,You don't know me at all,(At all!),What?,
