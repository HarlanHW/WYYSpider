作曲 : Imani Coppola/Adam Pallin/Michael Mangini,I see his thumbs working overtime lately,Immersed in a text you sent discretely,She probably a cool chick, light-skinned, pretty,Come to think of it she probably a lot like me,It’s a low blow but I act like I don’t know,You used to stay now you say you gotta go,Your excuses are very original,But you got no organizational skills,I get a text two seconds after you leave,Obviously meant for her, not for me,It said 'whats up ***y? Are you gonna come through?,Let a brotha know what a sista gonna do',Text me back 'X X O O,I miss your embrace sideways happyface :-）',Oops,Did your thumbs have a nervous twitch?,You just sent the wrong text to the wrong *****,LOL,I text your celly,Gotta spell out: Go to hell,Toss you in the trash,Then reduce you to an acronym,WTF? You reply,I laugh so hard I almost cry,Beat you to the punch line,Broke your heart before you broke mine,How you gonna go try and play me out?,Why you gonna go and fill my head with doubt?,Clouds and **** I don’t wanna deal with,All stressed out shouting, throwing a fit, cmon,How you gonna lie your way out of this one?,You think it might be time for a confession?,You’ve left no room for any more fabrication,Boy a cell phone could be a dangerous weapon,Next time check if the safety’s on,Trigger-happy fingers can expose the gun,Woah what a tangled web we’ve spun,Now it’s on son I’m about to have some fun,I make sure the I.D.’s unknown,I text you back from another phone,‘Yeah baby I’m coming through,I’ll meet you on the avenue’,LOL,I text your celly,Gotta spell out: Go to hell,Toss you in the trash,Then reduce you to an acronym,WTF? You reply,I laugh so hard I almost cry,Beat you to the punch line,Broke your heart before you broke mine,LOL LOL LOL,LOL LOL LOL,I’m’a kick back and watch **** go down,While you’re standing, waiting for her to come around,An hour goes by and still no sign,So you text her back, oh, one more time,‘Where you at girl you said you was gonna meet me’,This time you send the message correctly,She writes back, ‘dawg, you blew up your spot,You’re talking bout a text that I never got,Who this girl you’re talking to?,Who this girl who coming through?,You’re messin with somebody else,*****, you just played yourself’,LOL,I text your celly,Gotta spell out: Go to hell,Toss you in the trash,Then reduce you to an acronym,WTF? You reply,I laugh so hard I almost cry,Beat you to the punch line,Broke your heart before you broke mine
