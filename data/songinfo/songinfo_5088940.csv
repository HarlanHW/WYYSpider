Nicole Scherzinger - Don't Hold Your Breath,,Don't hold your breath,,,You can't touch me now there's no vision left,If you think I'm coming back don't hold your breath,What you did to me boy I can't forget,If you think I'm coming back don't hold your breath,,I was Sunday yes now there's such a long time come and break the chains,You played with my heart told me ...all your lies and games,It took all the strength I had but I crawled up on my feet again,Now you're trying to lure me back but no those days are gone my friend,I loved you so much that I thought that someday you could change,But all you brought me was a heart full of pain,,You can't touch me now there's no vision left,If you think I'm coming back don't hold your breath,What you did to me boy I can't forget,If you think I'm coming back don't hold your breath,,Don't hold your breath,,I was worried about you but you never cared about me none,You took my money and I knew ...,I gave you everything but nothing was ever enough,You were always jealous over such crazy stuff,,You can't touch me now there's no vision left,If you think I'm coming back don't hold your breath,What you did to me boy I can't forget,If you think I'm coming back don't hold your breath,,Don't hold your breath,,Move on don't look back,I jumped off a train running off the tracks,Love is gone face the facts,A bod movie ends and the screen fades to black,What you did to me boy I can't forget,If you think I'm coming back,,You can't touch me now there's no vision left,If you think I'm coming back don't hold your breath,What you did to me boy I can't forget,If you think I'm coming back don't hold your breath,,You can't touch me now there's no vision left,If you think I'm coming back don't hold your breath,What you did to me boy I can't forget,If you think I'm coming back don't hold your breath,,
