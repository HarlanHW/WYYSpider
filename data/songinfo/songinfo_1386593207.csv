作词 : 无,作曲 : 无,Sweet dreams are made of this,甜蜜的梦境由此而生,Who am I to disagree,我有什么资格来反对,I travel the world and the seven seas,大千世界已被我一一游历,Everybody's looking for something,每个人都在追寻一些东西,Looking for something,或是美梦成真,Looking for something,或是腰缠万贯,Looking for something,或是名扬四海,Looking for something,或是得一人心,Somethingsomething something,一切都那么不切实际,Sweet dreams are made of this,甜蜜的梦境开始浮现,Who am I to disagree,也让我沉醉不已,I travel the world and the seven seas,漫漫红尘早已被我看腻,Everybody's looking for something,世人都想获得一些东西,Sweet dreams are made of this,甜蜜的梦境像勾人的红唇,Who am I to disagree,也让我意乱情迷,I travel the world and the seven seas,芸芸众生我都了如指掌,Everybody's looking for something,他们都被欲望驱使着追寻,Sweet dreams are made of this,甜蜜的梦境是美丽的仙境,Who am I to disagree,也让我流连忘返,I travel the world and the seven seas,世间纷杂我慢慢捋清,Everybody's looking for something,他们都想要些不可及的东西,Sweet dreams are made of this,甜蜜的梦境慢慢浮现,Made of this..........,由我们的欲望而生
