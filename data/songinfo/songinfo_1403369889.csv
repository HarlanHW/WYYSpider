作词 : Larry Gashi/Nathan Cunningham/Marc Sibley/William Grigahcine,作曲 : Larry Gashi/Nathan Cunningham/Marc Sibley/William Grigahcine,Sometimes don't wanna fall in love 'cause I'm sick of lies,Sick of lies,When you not around all I got is tears in my eyes,In my eyes,Mama praying saying boy that you'll be fine,You're the first and the last thing that's always on my mind,I need you to come over and save me now,Tell 'em all that you love me now,Please don't you ever put me down,Make me put this gun down now,Put this gun down,I need you to come over and save me,I need you to put this gun on safety,I hate that you just said you hate me,I need you come over and save me right now,Broke my heart into pieces,Never thought you would leave me,Girl your mind like the seasons,Switching up for no reason,Never thought you would leave me,It's so hard to redeem it,Girl you got me spinning around and around,I need you to come over and save me now,Tell 'em all that you love me now,Please don't you ever put me down,Make me put this gun down now,Put this gun on safety
