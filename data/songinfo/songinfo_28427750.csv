I took my baby on a Saturday bang,,Boy is that girl with you,Yes we're one and the same,,Now I believe in miracles,And a miracle has happened tonight,,But, if you're thinkin' about my baby,It don't matter if you're black or white,,I said If You're Thinkin' About My Baby,It Don't Matter If You're Black Or White,,I said If You're Thinkin' About My brother,It Don't Matter If You're Black Or White,,They print my message in the Saturday Sun,I had to tell them I ain't second to none,And I told about equality and it's true,Either you're wrong or you're right,,But, if you're thinkin' about my baby,It don't matter if you're black or white,,I am tired of this devil,I am tired of this stuff,I am tired of this business,Sew when the going gets rough,I ain't scared of your brother,I ain'ts scared of no sheets,I ain't scared of nobody,Girl when the goin' gets mean,,Protection,For gangs, clubs, and nations,Causing grief in human relations,It's a turf war on a global scale,I'd rather hear both sides of the tale,See, it's not about races,Just places,Faces,Where your blood comes from,Is were your space is,I've seen the bright get duller,I'm not going to spend my life being a color,,Don't tell me you agree with me,When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye,,But, if you're thinkin' about my baby,It don't matter if you're black or white,,I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby,It don't matter if you're black or white,,I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother,It don't matter if you're black or white,,NO Matter If You're Black Or White,,NO Matter If You're Black Or White,,It's Black, It's White It's Tough For You To Get By,It's Black , It's White It's Tough For You To Get By,It's Black, It's White It's Tough For You To Get By,It's Black , It's White It's Tough For You To Get By,,Black Or White,,Black Or White,,Yea, yea, yea,,Black Or White
