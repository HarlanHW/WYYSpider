I never thought that I could be so satisfied,从未想过我会这么心满意足,Every time that I look in your angel eyes,每次凝视你天使般的双眸,A shock inside me that words just can't describe,言语无法形容我内心受到的震撼,And there's no explaining,这一切无从解释起,Something in the way you move, I can't deny,你的每个动作我都无法抗拒,Every word from your lips is a lullaby,你说的每个字都像催眠曲,A twist of fate makes life worthwhile,命运的扭转使生命更有意义,You are gold and silver,你就是黄金珍宝,I said, I wasn't gonna lose my head but then,我说过我不会失去理智,但是,Pop! Goes my heart,砰!直入我心,(Pop! Goes my heart),(砰!直入我心),I wasn't gonna fall in love again but then,我不想再坠入爱河,但是,Pop! Goes my heart,砰!直入我心,(Pop! Goes my heart),(砰!直入我心),And I just can't let you go,我就是不能让你离去,I can't lose this feeling,我不能失去这段感情,These precious moments, we have so few,我们拥有的宝贵时刻是那么的少,Let us go far away, where there's nothing to do but play,让我们一起到远方,一个什么都不用做只要玩乐的地方,You've shown to me that my destiny's with you,你让我明白我跟你是命中注定在一起,And there's no explaining,这一切无从解释起,Let's fly so high, will you come with me tonight?,让我们翱翔天际,今晚要跟我一起吗?,In your dress, I confess, you're the source of light,我承认,你的优雅,你是光亮的来源,The way you shine in the starry skies,在灿烂的星空中闪耀,You are gold and silver,你就是黄金珍宝,I said, I wasn't gonna lose my head, but then,我说过我不会失去理智,但是,Pop! Goes my heart,砰!直入我心,(Pop! Goes my heart),砰!直入我心,I wasn't gonna fall in love again, but then,我不想再坠入爱河,但是,Pop! Goes my heart,砰!直入我心,(Pop! Goes my heart),砰!直入我心,And I just can't let you go,我就是不能让你离去,I can't lose this feeling,我不能失去这段感情,A twist of fate makes life worthwhile,命运的扭转使生命更有意义,You are gold and silver,你就是黄金珍宝,I said, I wasn't gonna lose my head, but then,我说过我不会失去理智,但是,Pop! Goes my heart,砰!直入我心,(Pop! Goes my heart),砰!直入我心,I wasn't gonna fall in love again, but then,我不想再坠入爱河,但是,Pop! Goes my heart,砰!直入我心,(Pop! Goes my heart),砰!直入我心,I said, I wasn't gonna lose my head, but then (I can't leave you now),我说过我不会失去理智,但是（我不能离开你）,Pop! Goes my heart,砰!直入我心,(Pop! Goes my heart),砰!直入我心,I wasn't gonna fall in love again, but then (I can't leave you now),我说过我不会失去理智,但是 （我不能离开你）,Pop! Goes my heart,砰!直入我心,(Pop!
