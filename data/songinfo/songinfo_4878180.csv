Wandering like a leaf upon the wind,I have been searching for someone,Holding out for a love to shake my soul,Heaven or nothing,Then you walked into my life,In a blaze of light,I've never wanted someone more,You are the one I've waited for,Light of my life,You’re the fire in my heart,When I am lost (lost),I know I'll feel you burning in the dark (oh),You're the light of my life,Every star in the sky,Shines more brightly when you're at my side,You're the light of my life (oh, it’s you) mmm,And dreaming, I feel you next to me,No, I'm not dreaming (oh, oh),Cause I'm drowning in your kiss,I die in your arms,And when I hear you call my name,Baby, it's like I'm born again,Light of my life,You’re the fire in my heart,When I am lost,When you’re lost I know,I'll feel you burning, burning in the dark,You're the light of my life,Every star in the sky,Shines more brightly when you're at my side,You're the light of my life, yeah,Your love's a lantern in the rain,Bringing me home time and again,Burning like an eternal flame,Light of my life,You're the beat of my heart,When I am lost,When you're lost I know,You'll see me shining,Shining in the dark,You're the light of my life,Like the stars in the sky,Only you can take me through,You're the only one who makes it right,Only you set fire to the night,You're the light (you're the light),You're the light of my life, mmm,Oh
